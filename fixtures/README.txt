This is the place for project wide fixtures.  

There may also be fixtures in a subdirectory of each app named fixtures (for example ./core/fixtures).  This is because the default test runner for Django's testing framework looks for fixtures loaded as part of the test cases there.  There may be a way to override this functionality, but I don't know how to do it. -Geoff Hing <geoffhing@gmail.com> 2010-11-16
